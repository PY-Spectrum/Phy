# Phy

The 'Phy' module dealts with the backend physics based calculations which is highly built around a body's motion in a 2d or a 3d space .....I will try my best to impliment more features in it but for now this is it .....I might prove handy for the ones working on appilcations which revolves around the usage of physics and other physics relatted backend stuffs

# Conditions

This module is entirely built for educational purpose and is not meant to be for commercial purpose .....If you wish to use it for commercial purpose check on to my main repository where you will see a list of ways to contact me.

# Other necessities

The 'npm-linker' package provided with it is really necessary for the main 'phy' file to work ,so make sure you have them added to your env variables or have them in the same directory or the folder.
